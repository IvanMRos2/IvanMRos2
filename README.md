### Iván Rosero 👋
Graduated from the Data Science 4 All program with Correlation One and Forte where I learned to handle data analysis technologies using Python
and SQL. I’m a food engineer graduated from University of Caldas where I began to build knowledge in programming and data handling. I studied a Master degree in University Pontificia Bolivariana where I carried out a research project about the differences between drying techniques. Currently I continue studying with Pereiran Technologic University the diplomat in programming technologies and also in a self-taught way to improve my skills and upgrade my profile in the area. 💻🖥️
